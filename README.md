Hardware Libraries for Altium Designer.


### Installing a Library


The project is divided by manufacture, where you can find a compiled library and this library's project.

```

Once you clone the project, the installation is really simple. Select **Install from File...** at **Available Libraries** dialog box. Chose the IntLib file that you want to install.

It's possible to install multiples libraries simultaneously. Just select a group of IntLib files that you want to install.
